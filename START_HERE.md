✅ **Multi-user accounts** with Supabase authentication  
✅ **Beautiful dark-mode UI** with minimalist design  
✅ **Create & manage alarms** with specific tasks  
✅ **Continuous alarm ringing** until task is verified  
✅ **ML-powered verification** using Vision framework  
✅ **Camera integration** for photo capture  
✅ **Cloud sync** of all alarms  
✅ **Two task types**: Brushing Teeth & Opening Laptop

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist & Clean**: Curvy buttons, spacious layout
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes for morning use
- **Intuitive**: No learning curve needed
- **Forceful**: Can't dismiss alarm until task is done!

## 🔐 Required Setup

Before first run, you **MUST**:

1. ✅ Add Supabase credentials to `Constants.swift`
2. ✅ Create database table in Supabase (via SQL)
3. ✅ Enable Email auth in Supabase dashboard

Optional but recommended:
- Add custom alarm sound (see ALARM_SOUND_SETUP.md)
- Test on physical device for full experience

## 🧪 Testing Flow

1. **Sign Up** → Create test account
2. **Create Alarm** → Set for 2 minutes from now
3. **Wait** → Alarm triggers and rings
4. **Take Photo** → Capture laptop or toothbrush
5. **Verification** → ML verifies and stops alarm
6. **Success!** → Alarm dismissed ✅

## 🎯 How It Works

```
User creates alarm
      ↓
Scheduled in local notifications
      ↓
Notification triggers at alarm time
      ↓
App opens with full-screen ringing view
      ↓
Alarm sound plays continuously in loop
      ↓
User taps "Take Photo"
      ↓
Camera opens and captures image
      ↓
ML Vision framework analyzes photo
      ↓
If verified: Alarm stops ✅
If not verified: Try again 🔁
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Supabase Credentials
**DO NOT commit your actual Supabase credentials to git!**
The `.gitignore` is configured to help, but be careful.

### ML Verification
- Requires **good lighting**
- Object should be **clearly visible**
- Works best with object as **main focus**
- May need multiple attempts in poor lighting

### Testing Tips
- Use physical device for best experience
- Simulator works for auth/UI but not camera
- Turn up volume to hear alarm
- Grant all permissions when prompted

## 📱 System Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Camera (for verification)
- Internet (for Supabase sync)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No Supabase URL" error | Add credentials to Constants.swift |
| Alarm doesn't ring | Check notification permissions |
| Camera not working | Grant camera permission in Settings |
| ML verification fails | Improve lighting, show object clearly |
| Build errors | Clean build folder (⌘⇧K) and retry |

## 🎉 What's Next?

### Test It
1. Follow SETUP_CHECKLIST.md
2. Create a test alarm
3. Experience the full flow
4. Verify everything works

### Customize It
1. Change colors in Extensions.swift
2. Add custom alarm sound
3. Modify task types in Task.swift
4. Add your app icon

### Enhance It
Future ideas to implement:
- Recurring alarms (daily, weekdays)
- More task types (exercise, reading)
- Statistics & streak tracking
- Social accountability features
- Difficulty levels
- Reward system

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First alarm?** Set it for 2 minutes from now to test
2. **ML not detecting?** Make sure object fills most of frame
3. **Need it louder?** Add custom alarm sound (see ALARM_SOUND_SETUP.md)
4. **Want to customize?** Check IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for architecture
